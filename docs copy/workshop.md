# GenAI Red Teaming Accelerator

This lab is a kickstarter project designed to help you easily start red teaming GenAI applications. It is based on the [PyRIT project](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/tree/main/doc/code/targets) and provides a simple, opinionated configuration of the PyRIT tool to enable prompt injection testing for a GenAI application. 

The lab supports two main approaches for prompt injection:
1. **API Endpoint Testing**: Targeting the application's backend API.
2. **Frontend Testing**: Targeting the application's user-facing interface.

### Lab Overview

This lab includes:
- A **demo application** to serve as the target for red teaming.
- Pre-configured **PyRIT settings** to facilitate prompt injection testing for both the API and frontend of the demo application.

### Structure

The lab is divided into two main sections:
1. **API Prompt Injection**: Demonstrates how to use PyRIT to inject prompts into the demo application's API.
2. **Frontend Prompt Injection**: Demonstrates how to use PyRIT to inject prompts through the demo application's user interface.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Follow the setup instructions provided in the respective sections for API and frontend testing.
3. Use the pre-configured PyRIT tool to perform prompt injection tests on the demo application.
