# GenAI Red Teaming Accelerator

A comprehensive framework for security testing GenAI applications using [PyRIT (Python Risk Identification Tool)](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT). This accelerator provides:

- **Interactive Notebooks**: Learn and experiment with PyRIT orchestrators
- **Non-Interactive Scanning**: Automated security testing scripts
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions for continuous security validation
- **Demo Applications**: Ready-to-use HTTP API and web app targets

## Quick Start

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

```bash
# 1. Configure environment
cp code/.env.example code/.env
# Edit .env with your Azure OpenAI credentials

# 2. Start demo applications
cd code/demo_target_apps
python run_demo_apps.py

# 3. Test with notebooks
cd code/notebooks
# Open api_target.ipynb or playwright_target.ipynb

# 4. Run non-interactive scan
cd code/scan
python run_pyrit_scan.py
```
